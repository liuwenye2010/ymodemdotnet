I needed to communicate with an old device using COM and it received files acording to the YModem protocol. So I searched the internet and found only v expensive 3rd party tools to do this. So I wrote it myself. To protect other programmmers from this horrible fate I give you this v simple non clean or commented version of my YModem implementation.

Improve on it if you want :) please keep me posted if you do.
